### Musereum Smart-Licensing Framework

Musereum is a multi-blockchain platform for managing intellectual property rights (IP rights) in the music industry. One of our goals is a simplification of a licensing procedure. On our platform smart-contracts allow to register IP rights and distribute the royalty honestly and automatically via ETM among right-holders. Right-holders own a certain percent of musical asset (the musical composition; the track) which allows to vote for managing this asset.

### DAL – decentralized autonomous label

DAL is a governing smart contract with associated musical composition.  Each DAL has a Charter which regulates decision making rules on issue and sell licenses, accumulate and distributes the royalty, etc.  All transactions are kept at Musereum. Hashing of time registration, which can indentify acquiring the share of the musical composition or otherwise, for example, is perpetual. No one can change it. It provides the security and grants the fair ownership and distribution of royalties and clear register of licenses.

The main idea of decentralized autonomous label is using a corporate structure on the musical assets. The Charter which defines the managing of DAL is one of these ‘corporate’ items.
The example of this Charter you can see here ([активная ссылка][ad4e9d39]).
